Not something my family did, etc. But I think it is important. Reflection is always important.\nTry. Fail. Learn.\nI’m not sharing those things here. I just wanted to say that I’m thankful for more than I know. It is important to let those involved to know that you are thankful and more importantly, why you are thankful. It’s easy to forget how acknowledging someone can make them appreciate you… and just make them feel better about themselves. Give the shit-show that appears to be coming for us all, it’s a good idea to feel good sometimes.\nSo get your asses out there and say THANK YOU!"

It is responsive and just enough clickiness to satisfy. To summarize as the yutes say.. 10/10 would recommend.\nBut, and it’s a big but that Anthony Ray would appreciate, you have to be ready to commit and retrain your brain."

I’ll be talking about my specific configuration, the Pro with Kailh Quiet Pink switches. There is a “brown” switch option. Or you can order a custom built version and specify switches, colors, keycaps, etc.\nThe pink switches are just the right balance of tactile clickiness and quieter sound. They are also very responsive. It took a few days of regular use to get accustomed to how sensitive they can be.\nI also got the wrist pad/rests, but I’ve found I prefer to not have them on. They are nice and magnetically attach to always be in the correct place. I tried several times to like them, but just found it more comfortable without them."

    "text": "Ergo, not ego\nI am not going to go into all the details of an ergonmic split keyboard, nor will I go into all the details of why or why not to choose one. There is a plethora of information out there on the topic. As before, you can use a search engine if needed.\nFor me, the ergonomics are top-notch. I’ve always loved a split keyboard, this is my first with thumb clusters. They are pretty natural and really reduce the finger travel to access certain keys. The biggest learnig curve is using the modifier keys.. shift, control, alt. etc. Finding the arrow keys also took awhile to get used to and I still am not 100% trained for them, yet.\nThis is an ortho-linear layout. The key columns are not offset, but instead directly above each other. This didn’t take as long to get used to as I had thought. After a few days, I wasn’t hitting the wrong keys at all due to the layout. Just my normal fat fingering of keys I’ve always had. One defining feature of the Advantage over other split keyboards are the deep concave wells the keys form. It’s integral to the ergonomics of it… and it works really well. My hands felt natural in this position the very first time I used the keybard.\nThe tenting options are good. I’ve experimented with them all and the lowest or middle is about right for me. I also find myslef rotating each half to different angles. This just depends on my body position and posture (I have mulitple monitors and rotate my position often)."

    "text": "P.R.O.\nIt’s now the official keyboard of PROHOUSE EMERALD CITY.. so I had to get the “pro” version. It has bluetooth connectivity unlike the non-pro version. It also use ZMK firmware.. an open source keyboard firmware. Like you, I also didn’t know what the hell it was at first. Basically, with it you can change just about anything about this keyboard. Kenisis also recently released a new version of their fork of ZMK that includes a GUI style interface to configure things. Previously you had to re-flash the firmware with new configurations, which could be a pain in the ass. With the new version, it just loads it for you and no flashing needed.\nMacros. I’m just starting the scratch the surface of the macros. Basically there are 4 dedicated macro keys. Handily near the index finger. Very powerful as macros can be.. mine are just set for copy-pasta at the moment.\nLayers. I haven’t started diving into layers yet. This is where the power really lies. There is 1 extra layer by default, for a number keypad. I’m trying to train myself to use it. Eventually, I’ll get more into the layers. Basicall, you can setup any number of layers which completely change the keyboard layout and functionality. For example, the keypad layer changes the u,i,o,j,k,l,m, keys to be a keypad. I’ve heard of other use it change their home row keys (a,s,d,f,etc) to have other functions as well. It’s probably the most powerful part of the firmware."

Couldn’t ask for more.\nYou will need to invest time into learning the layout. It takes time and practice. So if you can commit, it’s 100% worth it all.\nThe thing is built like a tank.
