Not something my family did, etc. But I think it is important. Reflection is always important.\nTry. Fail. Learn.\nI’m not sharing those things here. I just wanted to say that I’m thankful for more than I know. It is important to let those involved to know that you are thankful and more importantly, why you are thankful. It’s easy to forget how acknowledging someone can make them appreciate you… and just make them feel better about themselves. Give the shit-show that appears to be coming for us all, it’s a good idea to feel good sometimes.\nSo get your asses out there and say THANK YOU!"
