# All will be revealed

Give me a fucking break with the "reveal" of anything. So much click bait ... "Your Mom **reveals** how she made dinner".
Please just stop.  Every other headline, video description, social media post... "**reveals**" something.  I can't fucking stand it anymore.

From this day forward, I will not click on nor read any article that "**reveals**" anything.  Be a like a 70's porn star and leave it natural, letting it all hang out.
